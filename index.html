          <p class="p1">
            I started to cook when I was 8 years old. My Family was always
            working and I needed to eat. It was just simple survival for me,
            then it became more of a passion the more I learned. It all started
            with an egg, I had Basically made an egg in everyway, shape, and
            form. Now I can't take the smell of eggs.

            Exept my many years of cooking, when I was in highschool, I had been
            in culinary for two years. My chef, Chef Moris is one of the best
            culinary teachers in the state. He has multilple awards, and I had
            learned much from him. After high school I hit the kitchen and made
            a name for myself. One day out of luck I met Bobby Flay, A well
            known Food Network Chef. He took me under his wing, I learned the
            best of my craft today because of him.

            Mexico has some of the best culture period, but there food is
            something else. From a simple fish taco to a complex ceviche. They
            have spice and tang. There is no meat off the table and no part that
            goes unused. When I went on a journey through mexico that is where I
            fell in love but not just with the food but with the people. Mexico
            is big and have many differnt types of culture within, with that in
            mind, I had never felt Unwelcomed.

            I don't like to cook, no. To keep it simple I do not like to cook
            for myself, it reminds me of a time where I had to cook. However, if
            someone asks me to cook for them, I, with joy, want to cook for
            them. It's a ways for me to put love in a language that I understand
            better.
