                    I started to cook when I was 8 years old. My Family was always working and I needed to eat. It was just simple survival for me, then it became more of a passion the more I learned. It all started with an egg, I had Basically made an egg in everyway, shape, and form. Now I can't take the smell of eggs.

                Exept my many years of cooking, when I was in highschool, I had been in culinary for two years. My chef, Chef Moris is one of the best culinary teachers in the state. He has multilple awards, and I had learned much from him. After high school I hit the kitchen and made a name for myself. One day out of luck I met Bobby Flay, A well known Food Network Chef. He took me under his wing, I learned the best of my craft today because of him.

            Mexico has some of the best culture period, but there food  is something else. From a simple fish taco to a complex ceviche. They have spice and tang. There is no meat off the table and no part that goes unused. When I went on a journey through mexico that is where I fell in love but not just with the food but with the people. Mexico is big and have many differnt types of culture within, with that in mind, I had never felt Unwelcomed.

            <p>
                I don't like to cook. To keep it simple I do not like to cook for myself, it reminds me of a time where I had to cook. However, if someone asks me to cook for them, I, with joy, want to cook for them. It's a ways for me to put love in a language that I understand better.
